		<h1>About me</h1>
		<h2>Who am I?</h2>
		<p>My name's Tom Duncan, a freelance web developer based in Coventry and Birmingham, UK. Currently my work is primarily focused on advanced Wordpress themes with modern, responsive frontend development. But I have a broad skill set capable of designing, planning and building all sorts of websites and web apps.</p>
		<p>I also have a big passion for the creative and visual side of web development – I love crafting rich, attractive user experiences that are clear and easy to use.</p>
		<p>My aim is always to solve <strong>complex problems</strong> with <strong>simple solutions</strong>.</p>

		<h2>Background & experience</h2>
		<p>My background is in Computer Science – I have a degree from the University of Nottingham – which gives me a deep understanding of the underlying concepts and processes and involved in all aspects of development. I am well equipped to learn new skills and adapt my knowledge and logic to many different programming languages and frameworks.</p>
		<p>But just as valuable is my three years of experience working in the industry. From 2014 to 2017 I worked for a digital agency in Birmingham. I was fortunate enough to work on projects for many different clients, from local businesses to major brands and organisations, such as Mitie, the City Bridge Trust, Allen & Overy, Metfriendly, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and lots more.</p>
